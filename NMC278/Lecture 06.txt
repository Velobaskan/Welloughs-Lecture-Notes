Interwar Turkey:
	Headgeaar ban
	Sufi and religious orders banned
		Rebellion of a prominent sheikh accelerated the bans
		They still exist today
	Turkification:
		There were many minorities in turkey.
		Regardless of language spoken, people were asked to think and act politically as "Turks"
		Non-national identities to be marginalized and subordinated to turkish national identity and loyalty.
		Kurds very numerous. They are slowly assimilated into turkish culture.
		Radical and comprehensive language reform in 1928
		Alphabet replaced altogether wih latin alphabet to eliminate literacy monopoly by religious minority + christian minorities.
			Persian and Arabian elements had to be removed from the language.
			This happened within a period of 3 months
			Literate turks were rendered illiterate in this short period
			They believed that short-term pain is essential for long-term prosperity.
			Growth in literacy seen as a major step in nation building.
		Without a national industrial base, they believed that the country's political independence might be compromised.
			After the Balkan wars, the country lost its financial resources
			Departure of educated christian people also left a highly unskilled lower class workforce
			They sought investments to build national economies
			Capitulations agreements expired in 1929.
			The financial crisis of 1929 paved the way for state-centered approach to industrialization in 1930's.
			Turkey got interest-free loans, advisors, equipment from USSR.
			A 5-year plan was inaugurated in 1934.
				Mostly internally financed, through taxation and employment of peasants.
				Atatürk was the pioneer of state capitalism in the country.
				Still, majority of workforce was employed in agriculture and agriculture was not reformed for a long time.
			Atatürk named "Atatürk" after the surname laws were implemented.
			Turkey's structure was the first of its kind in the region. It was used as a model by other middle eastern nations after they gained independence from western countries.
Interwar Iran:
	Iran was under British rule in this period.
	Nationalist movements emerged, but they did not have a common goal (except for eliminating the western influence over the counry.)
	Britain occupied southern oil fields and defended against the bolsheviks at north.
		This brought more support to nationalist groups
	Iran sought help from US. Mostly economical support + loans.
	By 1921, Britain stopped pressing Iran to sign the 1919 treaty.
	Reza Khan:
		In February 21, 1921, a colonel from the Cossack Brigade, Reza Khan demanded that the government appoint a revolutionary to a government office, and he asked to be the war minister.
		Sayyid Zia al-Din (pro-biritish moderate) was appointed prime minister.
			pushed for land reform.
			planned a modern industrialized economy. 
			Annulled british agreeements
			Restored relations with the USSR.
		Communist parliament in north supported Reza Khan's argument that there was strong division in the counry		
		By 1925, he was strong enough to abolish the Qajar dynasty. He assumed kingship + title of shah.
		After that point, he was called Reza Shah Pahlavi.
		Under his rule:
			Iran became a "modern state", ruled through centralized bureaucratic institutions. Monopoly of legal force within borders.
			County was strongly influenced by modern Turkey
			Women's rights expanded.
			Persian was accepted as the official language of state.
			Political life was heavily suppressed, but intellectual activities continued to spread.
			Universial military conscription was introduced.
			Urban and rural police forces strenghtened, became an instrument of government rule.
			Organized the army on a british model. Created iran's largest armed force so far.
			People were very unhappy with his political repression.
			In 1931, unilaterally cancelled the concession to a british oil company. The agreement was renewed in 1933 so that iran got more revenue from the oil produced, but the agreement was extended to 1993.
			National bank was established in 1927. It was the first national bank in Iran.
			Reza shah was supported by many strong intellectual groups in his early years.
			He wanted to subject Iranians directly to state authority (just like Atatürk's aims).
			Pastoral nomads were forced to resettle under threats by the armed forces.
			Ulema was pressured further as their autonomy decreased. New laws were passed to exclude them from bureaucracy.
			Dar-al Fanun was pressured to pursue modern education.
			Unlike Turkey, where religious institutions were completely subjugated, Ulema still maintained their rights in Iran.
			Public education institutions were expanded.
		Oil industry and national infrastructure:
			Reza Shah invested in expanding the country's modern production capabilities and its infrastructure.
			Oil revenues were a key part in the state income.
		Cultural wars:
			Islam was seen as a source of backwardness. Iran's pre-islamic past was emphasized.
				They believed that iran's modernization should not be achieved by imitation of western nations, but from using Iran's pre-islamic roots.
				Pre-islamic dynasties were held as archetypes of statehood.
				The belief that Iran was modernized DESPITE the prominence of islam was emphasized.
			Reza shah was hostile to islamic norms.
				He aimed to reduce the infuence of religious traditions in everyday life.
				Outdoor religious processions and ceremonies were supporessed.
				Hijab was banned outright.
		Expansion of military was seen as a necessary investment to ensure strength and sovereignity.
Interwar Egypt:
	Britain was occupied by British forces since 1880's.
	Egyptian political leadership emerged in the years prior to WW1, being called the representatives of people. They believed that british protectorate would end after WW1 if Egypt participated in the war.
	Woodrow Wilson stated that allies had to respect national self-determination. Egyptian elites thought brits would honour this.
	After WW1, British soldiers remained in Egypt, mainly to secure the suez.
	Emergence of Wafd:
		Egypt politicans announced their intention to form a delegation to represent Egypt at 1919 conference
		They signed a petition to go to Paris to represent Egypt
		Brits arrested all delegates. The delegates were hailed as national heroes overnight.
	Sa'd Zaghlul and 1919 Revolution:
		Sa'd Zaghlul became a national hero overnight.
		Nationwide revolt in forms of riots and demonstrations in favour of egyptian independence.
		People resented the british rule, especially after the martial law during WW1
		There were many groups. Their common goal was the overthrow the british influence.
		Britain had 2 options:
			military suppression (too expensive)
			making a compromise, meeting the egptians halfway
		Britain chose 2nd option. They did not meet Wafd, but the met the Egyptian sultan (from ali dynasty).
			Negotiations lasted until 1922, but no agreement was reached.
			Britain made an unilateral declaration to make Egypt an "independent" state, still reserving 4 points:
				Britain retained the right to reserve a garrison in suez canal.
				Britain reserved the right to defend egypt against any foreign power (declares egypt under british sphere of influence)
				Capitulations and extra rights for religious minorities would be preserved.
				Britain demanded that the status quo remain in Sudan (ie. it will be egyptian territory, but under British control.)
	Egypt was not happy about the agreement. They had some internal autonomy at most.
		Constitution proclaimed in 1923, parliamentary elections held in 1924.
		Egypt was declared as a liberal constitutional monarchy. A member of ali dynasty became a king and head of state.
		King and Britain saw the parliament and wafd as a rival in the country's rule.
			Britain supported the Wafd to destabilize the country, reduce the powers of wafd.
			Most parliamentary members were large landowners. They were insensitive to the plight of the poor.
	Emerging social-political forces:
		School graduates found their opportunities to be limited.
		Unemployed graduates developed critiques of the society. They affiliatd themselves with various opposition parties.
		The muslim brotherhood emerged.
	The muslim brotherhood:
		Founded by Hassan al-Banna, a school teacher, in 1928.
		Questioned whether modernisation and islamisation was possible at the same time.
		They believed that Egypt would remain weak as long as the monarch under british control had power.
		Also defended that elites of Egypt had lost touch with their culture and core values.
		Leadership:
			Many middle class, white collar professionals and degree holders
			They organized primarily among the urban poor (neglected by the ruling class)
			Worked around mosques and urban centres.
			Gave employment opportunities to the rural poor, who were ignored by the government.
		Established workshops for people, employed poor people, rallied millions of people to their cause.
		By the time of WW2, they were a mass organization spread to other arabic-speaking countries, especially establishing branches among their intellectual class.
		They were adamant about national independence.
		They defended workers' rights and the constitution, helping the urban poor.
		They became the first large-scale modern islamic movement in the middle east.
		They were effective in 2011 uprising, but they are marginalized since then.
	One notable achievement of the parliamentary system was the anglo-egyptian treaty of 1936
		Britain would recognize egypt's independence and they would sponsor egypt's membership in LoN.
		Britain would maintain their right to have a military garrision in the suez canal only, but only for 20 years (1956.)
		Egyptian army was placed under egyptian command for the first time since 1882.
