	--> Seriously disturbed the balance of power in Europe

Reasons behind Military Success
	Development of artilery with deadly efficiency and quality

		For comparison, American and German armoured formations advanced ~50km per day.
	New formations. Concentrated at breaking point of enemy.
		Mass artillery bombardments
		Voltigeurs --> sniping enemy officers
		--> This is the base of Blitzkrieg.
	Highly motivated citizen-soldiers fighting for their own country, rather than drafted soldiers in armies.
		Advancement in rank is also allowed in French army. This motivated soldiers to do better. "Army of promotion"
		Napoleon respected all his soldiers, motivating them.
	Logistical improvements. Field hospitals. Soldiers' needs taken care of.
	Enemies of France not coordinated in their efforts.
