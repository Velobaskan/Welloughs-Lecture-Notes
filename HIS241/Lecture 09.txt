Frankenstein, Family and Feminism
-------------------------------
Question: Is Frankenstein a social novel, one that follows Shelley's thoughts and experiences?
At that time, there was a debate on the meaning of life. A difference in thoughts between biology and religion.
Wollstonecraft:
	* Education is necessary for women and their rights.
	* How can women have capable companions of men if they don't go beyond being simple helpers.
		The progress of knowledge and virtue cannot be passed on if they are not educated.
	Believes that the idea of women being created by men was put in place to treat them as inferior beings.
