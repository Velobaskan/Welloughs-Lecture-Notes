Europe after Napoleon - Congress of Vienna and the International System
-------------------------------
**After the defeat in Russia, Napoleon left his army and returned to France with haste. He was fleeing the front, but wwith the idea that he had to keep the country together.

Napoleon had risen to power through his merit rather than familty collections. He proved himself in the Paris military school. Later on, his armies conquered Europe and transformed it in many aspects. He created the greatest European empire since the Romans.
The French army called themselves the soldiers of liberty, coming to break tradition in the regions they conquered.
In the regions that was brought under French rule:
	- Feudalism was abolished. Old governments were toppled and new ones were installed.
	- Positions in state matters were open to the skilled, not to the priveleged.
	- Property rights were opened to the public. The church was made a subordinate of the state and the clergy were to be paid by the state.
	- The Napoleonic legal code was applied as the code in these regions.
		- The religious minorities released people in Europe from religious persecution, removed clothing restrictions. The jews in Europe benefited greatly from these changes.
	- A radical idea of citizenship was made universal (except for women and children).
		- All political rights were assigned to the sense of citizenship, so women had a limited right of property and domestic rights.
	- The 300-or-so states (in HRE) with different rules and traditions were brought together under a common system.

Napoleon's defeat was achieved through the alliance of Russia, Austria, Prussia and Britain, called the "Grand Alliance". This is the start of the idea of great powers.
	The sense of nationalism in Germany can be traced back to the Battle of Nations in Leipzig (October 1813), where people from many German nations were brought together to fight the French. What brought them together was the thought of a common struggle as German people, not representatives of their individual nations.
After Napoleon's defeat, he was exiled to Elbe and the Grand Alliance restored monarchy of the Bourbon dynasty. This was the first peace.
Napoleon returned from exile and was defeated in Waterloo again, then was exiled again.
Congress of Vienna assembled after Napoleon's last defeat and decided to negotiate a long-lasting peace between nations.
	- They agreed that peace could not be achieved if the losing side was humiliated.
	- Boundaries were redrawn by the participating nations.
		- Victors were awarded territory at the expense of losing side.
		- Austria became the most prominent part of continental Europe. They became the head of the German Conferedation, Prussia was the second head.
		- France was restored to its 1795 boundaries.
		- The lowlands were released under a new kingdom.
		- Poland was divided by its neighbours (Prussia, Austria and Russia). This division took the longest time to resolve.
			- The Polish border defined the power and influence of Russia in Europe, and the other nations sought to limit that.
			- Austria and Britain was opposed to the Russian expansion. Britain, the most influential participant in the conference, decided most of the borders.
			- Austria and GB signed a treaty and agreed to go to war over this matter.
			--> The matter of Saxony defined the issue. GB and AUS wanted independence of Saxony under the king of Saxony. Prussia wanted it to be an independent state under its own borders. They wanted punishment for Saxony since they allied with Napoleon.
				- Austria wanted to keep Prussia under control so no. --> balance of power issue.
				- Members of the British government saw Prussia as a threat at the time.
				- ^ fair because the Prussian generals wanted vengeance for the war with France.
		Border changes:
			- Russia:
				- got Warschau and the kingdom of poland
			- Austria:
				- got lands near northern italy, they also got to dominate the politics in Italy. --> resulted in Italian unification
			- Prussia:
				- had done a lot in the war, and was one of the largest and most transformed nations in Europe. 
				- They acquired Westfall and lands on the Rhein. -> Ruhr was the center of their industrial revolution because of the coal reserves underneath.
				- They also got 3/5 of kingdom of Saxony.
				- They also got a big catholic population
		* Britain was happy:
			- Russia was awarded but their presence in Europe was contained by neighbours
			- Prussia was also awarded but Austria was there to keep them in check
			- Austria was rather decentralized, so they did not gain much overall, but they kept their status quo.
	- Monarchs were returned to power, Napoleon and his relatives were removed from power.
		- The divine right of kings was reestablished as the base of authority.
		- Court rights and priveleges were returned to the king's decision.
		- The monarchs sought to eliminate popular sovereignity. They tried to return to the absolutist system.
		- "The conservative restoration"
	- Some things were not restored, though:
		- Church lost their power permanently. The land they lost was not returned.
		- The idea of civil marriage remained
		- Birth records and registrations were kept
		- State became the source of education, not the church
		- State-enforced law became common. The Napoleonic code was kept to an extent
		- The structure and status of HRE was changed.
	
The concert of Europe:
	- Nations agreed to come together and discuss matters rather than going to war with each other.
	- Also saw that the nations could work together and collaborate to crush popular movements together.
