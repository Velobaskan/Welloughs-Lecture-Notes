Romanticism and Radicalism
-------------------------------
Liberalism (cont.):
	Preferred to have poitical institutions that would restrict the power of monarch.
		Institutions that would either work with the king or bind the king
		Constitution.
		Defending the idea of individual rights
			Violation of individual rights by a political institution makes it illegitimate
			Individual freedom is the root of the political thought.
			It is not absolute, however. They may exercise their rights as long as they do not interfere with that of the others.
		-> Domain of liberty; liberty of right, expression, thought and feeling
			Freedom of assembly idea: people can come together and discuss political matters.
Romanticism:
	Nature is regarded to as the work of god - a sight of divine power.
	Shifting the focus from rationality (reason) to emotions.
		Art is seen as a way to convey knowlege and messages, a way to give people a view of different worlds.
		Some artists held emotion above all else, and those who created were seen as gods
	In addition, ideas of community (in nature, in family, between family and children) are emphasized.
	Individualism is emphasized and supported.
		-> Freedom of individuals, also a part of the later ideas of democracy.
The July Revolutions:
	Uprising in France in 1830.
		The Bourbon monarch is challenged as he tried to reimpose absolute rule, but he is opposed by a middle class revolt.
		The king is ousted and a relative is put on the throne.
		-> This is not a radical revolution, it was an uprising against a single monarch.
	In Poland, there was a more radical nationalist uprising in 1830 and 1831 against the Russian rule. It was put down brutally.
	The Hambach Festival in May 27, 1832.
		At least 10,000 people involved.
		The nationalist flag is used in the festival.
		This was a demonstration in support of the dissemination of political thoughts. In response, restrictions are expanded.
