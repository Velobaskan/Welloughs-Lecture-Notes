New Political Languages: Conservatism, Liberalism, Radicalism
-------------------------------
(After 1815 was a period of conservative restoration.)
(The changes that happened during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era were restored but some ideas remained.)

New political ideas were established in this era.
	Individual freedoms were emphasized
	Different groups had varying opinions on whether change is good for the society.
		Their interpretations of the recent past affected their opinions on the present and future.
		The revolution had multiple phases, each with their own characteristics.
Conservatism:
	Edmund Burke is seen as the founder of conservatism
		Anglo-Irish elite.
		He did not welcome the revolution, he did not think it was necessary.
			He thought it was rather dangerous.
			* If religious traditions are uprooted the results could be disastrous
			(Radical) individualism is dangerous and it will lead to a dangerous unraveling of the social fabric.
			* If traditional social bonds are questioned or loosened, and if hierarchy and patriarchy is loosened, the end result will be confusion, chaos and violence.
		Argued in favour of the hierarchy in society
			Did not belive that everyone could understand the matters of state, so they don't need to be involved in matters.
				* The revolution is a social experiment that will not work.
				* Man is inherently evil, and freedom will unleash the evil in the world. -> This needs to be kept under control.
	Klemens von Metternich
		Foreign minister of Austria
		-> The voice of reaction in this period.
		* Reason itself is the enemy. The dissemination of such items will weaken the society and lead to a revolution and violence.
			Discusson on god and religion, and the resulting rejecton of them led to people questioning the divine right of the monarch.
		* He thought that the new "enlightened" society in France was the most degenerate example of thought.
	Joseph de Maistre
		Believed in the divine right of kings.
		* The social hierarchies of master and servant are disturbed if they are questioned or discussed. If they are disturbed, there will be chaos.
		* In the family, the man is the patriarch, the king of the family. It shall not be disturbed.
		* Men should not try to write the constitution. He believed that it was a divine work and the existing laws were already established as the best for the society.
			-> He is dismissive of the revolutionaries. He does not want change.
		* Teaching people how to think objectively, decide for themselves is not helpful. When an education system is not based on religion the society and state will collapse.
			-> The church should have authority over education. (Schoolmaster vs priest for education)
Liberalism:
	Did not focus on the dangers of the revolution, but looked at the benefits of it.
	* The state should be the entity that educates
	* One should be free to discuss and criticize religion
	* Religious requirements for citizenship and class should be eliminated.
	* Press should be free, ideas should be freely exchanged
	* All must be equal before law
	* Property based suffrage should be eliminated.
	Madame de Stael
		Born to a noble family in France and was highly educated.
		The first work she wrote was a play on the tragedy of Lady Jane Grey, who fought and died for her principles.
		Married to a Swedish diplomat.
			Protected by diplomatic immunity.
			Moved around Europe and published extensively
			Her works were popular in the German Confederation, inspired some of the liberals in the region.
		Focused mainly on Napoleon. Not as the liberator as he was seen earlier, but as a tryrant.
			* Takes all the revolution has accomplished and turns them around to the point of autocracy.
			* The steps taken to ensure liberty also proved to be useful for the estblishment of tyranny.
			* The state of emergeny was continued indefinitely and the rule of law was always delayed with some excuses.
			* Free press became propaganda with no right for contradiction.
			* Napoleon undid all the changes of revolution and used his power to exile anyone who disagreed. Became a true tyrant.
